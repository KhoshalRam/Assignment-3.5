High Availability in Hadoop:
    There are two NameNodes in a Hadoop system in an active-standby a configuration. When the Active NameNode fails to perform the Standby NameNode
    takes up the responsibilities of Active NameNode without interruption.
    
Automated Failover:
    The Hadoop by default detects NameNode host and process failures and will automatically switches to the switch to the standby
    NameNode to maintain the availability for the HDFS service. There is no need for human assistance in the process. 
    
Hot Standby:
    Both Active and Standby NameNodes have up to date HDFS metadata, ensuring seamless failover even for large clusters- which means no downtime for HDP cluster.
    
Full Stack resiliency:
    The entire Hadoop stack has been certified to handle a NameNode failure scenario without losing data or the job progress. 
    
Hadoop High Availability Architecture:    
    If we look into the architecture, we can outline the different components that are built into HDP to privide this functionality.
    In each cluster, two seperate machines are configured as NameNodes. In a working cluster, one of the Name Node machine is in Active State,
    and the other is in the standby state.
    
        The Active Node is responsible for all client operations in the cluster. The Standby NameNode maintains enough state to provide a 
    fast failover. In order for the Standby Node to keep its state synchronized with the Active Node. Both nodes communicate through a group of seperate daemons 
    called Journal Nodes. The file system journal logged by the Active NameNode at the Journal is consumed by the Standby NameNode to keep its file system 
    namespace in sync with the Active NameNode. 
      
        Data Nodes are configured with the locations of blocks in your cluster. DataNodes are configured with the location of both the NameNodes 
        and send Block location information and heartbeats to both NameNode machines. 
        
    The need of Zookeeper kicks in now. 
        The Zookeeper Failover Controller (ZKFC) is responsible for HA monitoring of the NameNode service and for
        automatic failover when the Active NameNode is unavailable. There are two ZKFC processes. One on each Name Node machine.
        ZKFC uses the Zookeeper Service for co-ordincation in determining which is the Active NwameNode and in determining when tho 
        failover to the Standby NameNode.
         
        In Hadoop setup, the HDFS clients are configured with a logical name service URI and the two NameNodes corresponding to it.
        The clients perform source side failover. When a client cannot connect to a NameNode or if the NameNode is in 
        Standby mode, it performs fail over to the other NameNode.
